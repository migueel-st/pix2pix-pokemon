# Conditional Pok√©mon Generation with Pix2Pix

This repository is a personal project exploring conditional image generation of Pok√©mon using a fork of the pix2pix framework. The input domain consists of silhouette masks colored by the Pok√©mon's primary type, and the output domain is the generated Pok√©mon image.

## TODO

### üîß Data Preparation
- [ ] Collect or create silhouette masks of Pok√©mon.

- [ ] Assign and apply colors to masks based on Pok√©mon primary types.

- [ ] Pair masks with corresponding official Pok√©mon images for training.


üèãÔ∏è Training
- [ ] Define training/validation split.

- [ ] Train on a subset of Pok√©mon (e.g., starters or first 150).

- [ ] Train on full [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types)

- [ ] Train on an even [bigger dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/djilax/pkmn-image-dataset/data) (might need to do manual labeling of the pokemon types or run it through some pre-trained pokemon type classifier)

- [ ] Experiment with hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, epochs, etc.).


üé® Output & Evaluation
- [ ] Generate Pok√©mon from unseen mask/type combinations.

- [ ] Compare generated results with ground truth Pok√©mon designs.

- [ ] Explore diversity and consistency of generations by varying the mask slightly.

üìà Enhancements
- [ ]Add a GUI or notebook interface to draw/select a silhouette and type.

- [ ] Add secondary type handling (e.g., gradient or dual-color silhouettes).

üìö Documentation

- [ ] Document how to run the project and reproduce results.

- [ ] Add sample inputs/outputs in the repo.
